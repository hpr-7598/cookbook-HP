## ðŸ”ª Ingredients

- 1 mug (250â€“350 ml) of milk
- 1/2 mug of water
- 2 green cardamom pods *(or 4 pinches of ground cardamom)*
- ~0.25" piece of fresh ginger *(or about 1/4 the length of your finger)* â€” add more if you're a ginger fan!
- 1.5 teaspoons of Brooke Bond Red Label loose leaf tea
- 1.5 teaspoons of granulated sugar *(not powdered)*

---

## ðŸ”ª Instructions

1. In a heavy-bottom saucepan, add:
   - Milk, water, tea powder, **crushed** cardamom pods, and **3/4 of the grated ginger**.
   - (Yes â€” *before* turning on the stove. Trust me.)

2. Place the saucepan on **medium heat** and let the mixture come to a simmer.

3. Let it gently simmer for about **12 minutes**. The color should turn a beautiful milky chocolate brown.  
   At this point, stir in the sugar.

4. Around the **14-minute mark**, add the **remaining ginger**, turn off the heat, remove the pan from the stove (to avoid spill-over from residual heat), and **cover it**.

5. Let it sit for **2 more minutes**, then strain the tea into your mug.

6. Sip and enjoy with your favorite snacks or cookies! *(Recipes coming soon...)*

> â˜• If you cut the simmer time short, youâ€™ll end up with a milky concoction â€” not proper chai. Be patient. Itâ€™s worth it.
